# This program gets three test scores and displays their average.  It congratulates the user if the 
# average is a high score. The high score variable holds the value that is considered a high score.

average = (int(test1) + int(test2) + int(test3)) / 3
#cm2 added int())
# Print the average.

#Q2
#The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles and prints to the user the area of both rectangles. 

r1l = input('Enter the length for rectangle 1: ')
r1w = input('Enter the width for rectangle 1: ')
r2l = input('Enter the length for rectangle 2: ')
r2w = input('Enter the width for rectangle 2: ')

area1 = int(r1l) *int(r1w)
area2 = int(r2l) *int(r2w)

print('The area of rectangle 1 and 2 are', area1, 'and', area2)

#Q3 
#Ask a user to enter their first name and their age and assign it to the variables name and age.
